# Ecologital Assignment

Ecologital Assignment Flutter (SSE)

In this project, I use [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) for state management, [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http)
for HTTP client, [json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) for serialization

### Choosing the State Management GetX
- Easy and Extra light state management framework
- Has additional routing features
- Easy dependency injection
